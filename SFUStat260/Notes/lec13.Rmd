## Visualization with `ggplot2`

* Build a plot with `ggplot` layers:
    - Start with `ggplot()` to specify default data and aesthetic mapping of x, y, color, shapes, etc.
    - Add `geom_()`'s, which can override default data and mapping.
    - `stat_()`'s calculate statistical summaries such as smooths that we can add. Rather than
    use the `stat_()`s directly, we tended to add summaries with built-in geoms, such as `geom_smooth()`.
    - Faceting builds multiple plots by values of a faceting variable.
* Advanced topics we did not emphasize include:
    - Position adjustment such as jitter or dodge to avoid overplotting.
    - Scales specify the mapping of data to what we see on the plot.
    - Coordinate system can be changed from Cartesian to, e.g., polar.
    - Themes change the overall look-and-feel of plots
* Visualization is often cookbook
    
## Data import and tidy

* Import with the `read_` functions, such as `read_csv()`.
    - remember `skip` and `comment` arguments
    - `read_` functions guess at how to parse columns of input and use `parse_` functions.
    - Best bet is to specify column types with `col_types=cols()`.
* `tibbles` are an improved version of the R `data.frame`.
    - Implemented as lists, so subset with `[` and extract elements with `[[`
* Use `dplyr`'s five key verbs to wrangle:
    1. `filter()` to select subsets of observations
    2. `arrange()` to reorder rows
    3. `select()` to select variables (remember helper functions like `starts_with()`, `ends_with()` and `contains()`)
    4. `mutate()` to create new variables from existing ones, and
    5. `summarize()` to calculate summary statistics (useful with `group_by()` to do split-apply-combine)

## Tidy Data

* In a tidy dataset,
    * each variable has its own column,
    * each observation has its own row, and 
    * each value has its own cell.
* Use `gather()` to make "wide" data "tall" and `spread()` to make "tall" data "wide".

## Relational data: multiple tables

* Modern data comes in multiple tables, called relational data. 
* Keys are variables present in two tables that can be used to join them.
* The most common type of join is a "mutating join", such as a `left_join()` or `inner_join()`.
* `semi_join()` can be used for a "filtering join" in which we filter one table based on
characteristics of another.


## Working with strings

* Fixed, or literal strings, like `fish`:
    - count the number of characters in a string
    - detect (yes/no) or find (starting position) substrings 
    - extract and substitute substrings
    - split and combine strings

* Regular expressions specify string patterns, like `f[aeiou]sh`:
    - detect, find, extract and substitute

* Use tools from the `stringr` package


## Factors

* Factors are categorical variables, implemented as an integer vector
with levels.
* The `forcats` package provides tools for working with factor levels.
* Use `fct_recode()` to rename or collapse factor levels.
* Use `fct_relevel()` to partially or completely re-order a 
factor's levels.
* Use `fct_reorder()` to reorder levels by a second variable.


## Dates and Times

* Moments in time can be dates, times, or date-times.
* The `lubridate` package contains functions to 
coerce strings to date, time, or date-time objects:
    * `ymd()` to coerce data in year-month-date, 
    `mdy()` to coerce data in month-day-year, 
    `ymd_hm()` to coerce data in year-month-date-hour-minute, etc.
* `make_datetime()` makes a date-time object from components.
* `hour()`, `minute()`, etc. extract components.
* Time data includes time zone. To set a time zone with the lubridate time functions, 
use the `tz` argument. 
* Easy to summarize and plot date-time objects.

## Pipes and functions

* The forward pipe `%>%` is useful for combining a linear
sequence of data processing steps, 
when we won't need the intermediate steps.
* Encapsuling code in a function has several advantages:
    * can be used multiple times on different inputs
    * can compartmentalize computations and give them a name
* We discussed when to write a function and the components of a function:
    - the code inside the function, or `body`,
    - the list of arguments to the function, and
    - a data structure called an `environment` inside the function
* Generic functions behave differently depending 
on the class of input. 

## Vectors and iteration

* Vectors can be either atomic or list
    - The elements of an atomic vector must be the **same** type.
    - Lists can be comprised of **multiple** data types
* Use `vector()` to create an empty vector, or `c()` and `list()` to construct from data.
    * vector elements can be named
* Subset with `[` or by name.
* Extract individual elements with `[[`, or `$` for named objects
* Combine subsetting and assignment to change the value of vectors
* Iterate over a vector with a `for()` loop, `lapply()` or `map()` functions
    * Remember shortcuts for specifying a function to use with a `map()` function.
