```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE)
```

```{r}

yvr <- read_csv("weatherYVR.csv")
yvr
```

In the above code chunk you read in **daily** weather
data from YVR in 2003.

1. Coerce the `Date/Time` variable to a date object
and rename it Date.

2. Do a time series plot (with lines) 
of the daily maximum temperature by day.

3. Change the `Month` variable from 
numeric to a factor.
(Hint: The `month()` function with the `label=TRUE` will
extract the months from a date-time object.)

4. Plot the average maximum temperature *versus* month,.
Redo this plot with months ordered by 
average maximum.
